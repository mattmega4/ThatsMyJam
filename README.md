# Thats My Jam

The idea is simple. Play your music! When your jam comes on...Lock it in!


Every song that you play has the option to lock shuffle mode on the currently playing album, artist, or genre. When you’ve had enough of that targeted shuffle just tap the button to unlock and go back to shuffling everything. 

• When locked song has played all similar items (in album, artist, or genre) the lock will disengage and music will continue to shuffle your music library!

• Everything is in one place - No annoying navigating back and forth through menus!

• Music Videos are not included and will not interrupt your normal phone usage!

• Will group sub genres (Blues: Electric Blues, Blues Rock, etc)!

Note: App only works if song metadata is filled in on iTunes!




## Getting Started

Visit ** OR ** directly to downlaod for free.

### Prerequisites

iOS 11.3 +

## Locking on Artist/Album/Genre

If you are a new user you will automatically be brought to the Add Card View Controller. 

Play a song. If you like that song and also like the Artist tap the lock icon above the word Artist to play more songs from that Artist. If you only have that 1 song from the Artist you will be prevented from tapping that button. Same logic for Album & Genre
